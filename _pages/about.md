## Projects
**[Cerebro AI - RAG Study Tool](https://github.com/kbai612/Cerebro-AI/tree/main)**
- Developed a web application that utlizes AI to generate study materials and answer complex questions in the form of a Tutor Chatbot, Flashcards and Multiple Choice Questions
- The app is integrated with Deekseek V3 for model reasoning, HuggingFace FlagEmbedding model for generating text embeddings, langchain FAISS for vector database storage, Google Drive API for storing a constant knoweledge base, langchain libraries for RAG and document processing, and Streamlit for the front end interface.
- The proposed method provides a unique way to go over study material, specifically being able to tailor the app to areas that need more attention or in depth analysis

**[Deep Q-Learning Snake AI]([https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048](https://github.com/kbai612/Reinforcement_Learning_Snake))**
- Implementation of Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning to train an AI agent to play the classic Snake game. This project demonstrates the application of deep reinforcement learning techniques to game environments, showcasing how an AI agent can learn optimal strategies through trial and error.

## Work Experience
**Technical Data Analyst @ StackAdapt (_August 2023 - Present_)**
-	Championed an industry leading media transcoding platform integration, working cross functionally with the engineering and product teams to enable client creatives to be able to run on key industry playerâ€™s ad placements including Disney, Paramount, NBCU and HBO Max, increasing YoY CTV spend by over 150%.
-	Developed a KPI monitoring system which utilized ThoughtSpot dashboards, email alerts and slack alerts to detect short term anomalies and monitor long term trends, leading to 95% of performance drops investigated and actioned off of.
-	Engineered a scalable data pipeline using Spark, AWS and Snowflake, orchestrated with Airflow for ETL processes. Implemented dbt for data transformation and developed Python scripts for data quality validation. This architecture enabled real-time campaign analytics through REST APIs, reducing reporting time by 45% and improving ad spend efficiency by 35% through data-driven optimization of ad inventory allocation. 
-	Utilized decision trees and feature engineering to determine fraudulent ad probabilities on an impression level, allowing for faster detection and blocks for fraudulent domain inventory, reducing false positives by 30% and increasing fraud detection accuracy by 80%.
-	Conducted A/B testing to validate an initial click-through rate hypothesis, adjusting frequency caps for different audience   segments which improved overall campaign efficiency and resulted in a 25% increase in spend and click KPIs.


**Business Intelligence Analyst @ Brokerlink (_December 2021 - May 2023_)**
-	Collaborated with Revenue and Leadership teams to implement a data-driven underwriting strategy, leveraging advanced analytics to reduce the average claim value by 12% and improve the loss ratio by 5% over 3 fiscal quarters.
-	Designed and implemented scalable data pipelines on AWS using Glue, Lambda, and S3, integrating with MariaDB for efficient data management, resulting in a 50% reduction in data processing time and saving the team approximately 20 hours per week on data-related tasks 
-	Spearheaded a data visualization project using Power BI for the commercial lines department, creating interactive dashboards to monitor KPIs, line health, and action items, resulting in a 15% improvement in data-driven decision-making and a 10% reduction in response time to critical alerts. 
-	Developed retention analysis using XG boost method applied in python for binary classification model and outputs with identification of clients with most likelihood of cancellation for stakeholder teams to proactively re-market, leading to an increased in commercial lines account retention by 40% from Q4 to Q1

**Data Analyst @ Nova Century Scientific Inc (_August 2020 - January 2021_)**
-	Developed and deployed a robust relational data warehouse solution utilizing SQL Server, integrating key metrics such as customer demographics, sales performance, and inventory levels, resulting in a 70% reduction in report generation time and a 12% improvement in data accuracy.
-	Collaborated with the leadership team to design and implement Power BI dashboards that facilitated real-time data analysis, resulting in a 32% increase in the identification of key data trends and a 25% improvement in tracking and monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs).
-	Leveraged VBA programming to enhance analysis formatting, report generation, data lookups, and interface functionality, resulting in a 50% improvement in data retrieval efficiency
-	Designed and maintained monthly performance reports that helped identify key trends and led to a 15% reduction in operational costs over six months.
